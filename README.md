# Simple Data Entry and Cleaning Project â€“ Cafe Sales Dataset
This is a simple project that involves cleaning a dataset

This project demonstrates my ability to clean and prepare raw datasets for analysis or reporting.  
The dataset used contains cafe sales records with common data quality issues such as missing values, blanks, and duplicates.  

## Data
The dataset was cleaned using **Google Sheets**.  
You can view the cleaned and raw dataset below:
RAW DATASET [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brp2TwvoKYPPXhbWzwH04uT5W3sKyWDNvxaWp3FIuFE/edit?usp=sharing).
CLEANED DATASET [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r30R53D_zLIJfu6IQLVt-EnlVx8_esMip87RhZFnOCE/edit?usp=sharing). 

## Cleaning Steps
- Observed the dataset to find issues and also think about how to solve them.
- Filled missing values in key columns using logical rules (eg using 2/3 values from the quantity, price per unit and total spent columns to get the missing value).  
- Replaced placeholder/error values with correct categories using context from the rest of the dataset.  
- Removed duplicate entries to ensure accurate records.  
- Standardized formats across columns (dates, categories, and text consistency).
- Use conditional formatting to highlight columns with values unknown in order to be filled in properly later on.
- Deleted 206 rows which had limited amount of information based on the missing values in columns (in a workplace setting, this would not be the case). 

## Before vs After
- **Before**: Raw dataset included blanks, duplicates, and inconsistent values.  
- **After**: Dataset is consistent, complete, and ready for analysis.  

## Results
The cleaned dataset ensures accuracy for reporting and analysis, and demonstrates practical data entry & data cleaning skills.
